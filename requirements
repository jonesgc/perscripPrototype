Due to this being a prototype the requirements are much simpler than would be would needed for a proper system.

These requirements were obtained with spreaking with people who utlise the current NHS methods of perscription collection at various pharmices in England, in addition to my own experience. 
While this is a small amount of data for the creation of these requirements it serves the purpose to create a proof of concept. 

Software Requirements:
- Controller components for physical hardware (scales)
- Debugging/Display components, this will output scale readings to the monitor for development and testing, ideally this component would display to a dedicated screen for the physical terminal.
- Interface with database, the database will be a contrived element of the prototype. To save time during development a real database will not be used rather a file containing JSON encoded data.
    However this data must be transmitted in such a manner than it could/should be encrypted.

Hardware Requirements:
-  Small board computer to act as the prototype machine which will be programmed and the hardware attached to.
    - Various pinout expansion slots for the hardware to be wired into.
    - USB connection for debugging.
- Load sensor euipment to build the scales.
